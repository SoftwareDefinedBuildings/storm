### Programming a TinyOS App on Storm

There is a TinyOS port for Storm under development [here](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/stormport). It is currently heavily oriented towards running the Synergy stack, which has a TinyOS kernel (apps/Kernel) so many other TinyOS applications will not run without (trivial) modification

To make a TinyOS application simply do:

```
$ make storm install
```
