### Programming a TinyOS App on Storm

There is a TinyOS port for Storm under development [here](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/stormport). It's a rebasing repository, so be prepared for the default branch to change from time to time.

To make a TinyOS application simply do:

```
$ make storm
```

Unfortunately, the typical make install targets do not work yet. To program the resulting binary using a JTAG programmer, you need to first convert the ELF to a bin file, then program the bin file into the flash at the offset expected by the bootloader. There is a Makefile that automates this, which you can get [here](http://storm.rocks/u/jtag/Makefile) you also require the [jlink script](http://storm.rocks/u/jtag/prog.jlink).

The whole process, assuming you are in the TinyOS app directory is then:

```
$ make storm
$ cd build
$ make prog
```
