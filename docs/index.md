### Hardware

Storm is a 16mm x 26mm (1/2" by 1") solder on module that combines a 32 bit Cortex M4 microcontroller with an 802.15.4 radio, and 64 Mbit of flash memory. This ultra low power module exports 80 pins via castellated edges, and is designed to be soldered into a larger PCB that contains additional sensors or actuatiors.

### Software

Storm is more than just a hardware platform, it's also a set of tools that makes Internet of Things development easier. Chief among this is the [Storm bootloader]({% post_url 2014-10-02-sloader %}). For information on the program memory layout and linker file, start there.
